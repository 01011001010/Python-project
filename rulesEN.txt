Hex is a board game invented in 1942 by Peit Hein and John Nash.
The hex board is an 11x11 hexagonal tiling in a rhombus shape.
Two players are assigned opposite edges of the board.
The board is empty at the start of the game, and the players have to put the pieces in, one by one.
To put a piece in, players drag jars with honey and release it over desired hexagon.
The goal of each player is to establish an unbroken chain of their pieces connecting the two sides of the board marked with their colour.
As the player placing the first stone has an advantage, the player is chosen randomly.
Moves entail placing a piece on an unoccupied hexagon. Already placed pieces cannot be moved.
There is no limit to the number of pieces, so players take turns placing new pieces until one of them reaches victory.
